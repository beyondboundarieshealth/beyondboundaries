                        Hi I am Lisa and I am an Occupational Therapist with ADHD. As someone who was diagnosed with ADHD as an adult, I understand the challenges of navigating mental health services and academic spaces without tailored ADHD support. I started Beyond Boundaries to create a safe and accountable space to support others to implement skills to feel well, and function in a way that works best for you. 
                    </div>
                    <div>
                        I offer Occupational Therapy services, ADHD coaching, and academic support. If you have a formal diagnosis of ADHD, or feel like life is a lot, reach out to me for a consultation to see if my services are a good fit for you.

            <label class="question" for="faq-toggle-1">What is Occupational Therapy (OT)?<span class="plus_minus"></span></label>
            <div class="answer">
                <div class="answer_margin">
                    <p>Occupational Therapy is a treatment approach that focuses on functioning. In order to enable clients to be able to do what they want to do, (and often need to do), OTs use approaches targetted at physical, cognitive, and mental health, in addition to environemntal factors that may be impacting the person.</p>
                    <p>Using this individualized approach, OTs work with clients to achieve functional goals that are unique to each person. This may look quite different depending on the practice setting (e.g., hospitals, schools, clinics, or long term care to name a few).</p>
                    <p>OTs typically work in a variety of settings AND with people of all ages! Check out our “Services” page to learn how a mental health OT can support you.</p>

            <label class="question" for="faq-toggle-2">What is the difference between an occupational therapist, psychotherapist, psychologist, and ADHD coach?<span class="plus_minus"></span></label>
            <div class="answer">
                <div class="answer_margin">
                    <p>An occupational therapist (OT), psychotherapist, psychologist, and a coach can all support people with ADHD effectively!</p>
                    <p>OTs typically use hollistic approaches considering all aspects of health and the environment, in relation to functional goals.</p>
                    <p>Psychotherapists, often focus primarily on mental health and reducing the impact of symptoms on an individual’s wellbeing.</p>
                    <p>Psychologists use a similar approach to psychotherapists, however they can also diagnose mental health conditions (such as ADHD!).</p>
                    <p>Coach’s typically work with people to invoke behaviour changes towards the individual’s desired goals. Often, psychotherapists and OTs will use coaching techniques in their practice.</p>
                    <p>OTs, psychotherapists, and psychologists are regulated healthcare providers (in Canada) and require specific education and experience to use these titles. These providers will be registered with their regulatory bodies provincially.</p>

            <div class="answer">
                <div class="answer_margin">
                    <p>Yes! We offer services for children and teens who are able to (and thrive!) in a virtual setting.</p>
                    <p>This may look like services for emotional regulation, self-esteem, and psychoeducation on ADHD brains. Other services may be academic support and improving skills such as organization, task initiation, and time management. With all children and teen services, parent/caregiver consultations are available.</p>
                    <p>If in-person services are a better fit for your child, we can help connect you to an OT in your area.</p>

                <div class="answer_margin">
                    <p>Yes. If you have extended health- insurance, be sure to check if there is coverage for registered occupational therapists (this may be in the physical health or mental health section).</p>
                    <p>After each session you will receive a detailed invoice to submit to your insurer for reimbursement.</p>

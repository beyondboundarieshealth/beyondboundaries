                        <p>I am an Occupational Therapist with ADHD. As someone who was diagnosed with ADHD as an adult, I understand the challenges of navigating mental health services and academic spaces without tailored ADHD support. I started Beyond Boundaries to create a safe and accountable space to support others to feel well and overcome challenges.</p> 
                        <p>I offer Occupational Therapy services, ADHD coaching, and academic support. If you have a formal diagnosis of ADHD and/or you feel overwhelmed with daily tasks, reach out to me for a consultation to see if my services are a good fit for you.</p>

                <div class="answer_margin">
                    <p>This is a common question because OT can look quite different depending on the practice setting. If you are interested in mental health OT, check out our Services page to learn how we can support you.</p>
                    <p>Occupational therapists are unique to other healthcare providers as they focus on an individual’s ability to function within their environment. To facilitate clients in achieving their goals and necessary tasks,OTs integrate physical, cognitive, and mental health approaches. Considering both health and environmental factors, OTs are equipped to address barriers to functioning. This approach enables OTs to work in various settings, such as hospitals, schools, clinics, and long-term care, serving individuals of all ages.</p>

            <div class="answer">
                <div class="answer_margin">
                    <p>Yes! We offer services for children and teens who are able to (and thrive!) in a virtual setting.</p>
                    <p>This may look like services for emotional regulation, self-esteem, and psychoeducation on ADHD brains. Other services may be academic support and improving skills such as organization, task initiation, and time management. With all children and teen services, parent/caregiver consultations are available.</p>
                    <p>If in-person services are a better fit for your child, we can help connect you to an OT in your area.</p>

                <div class="answer_margin">
                    <p>Yes, depending on your insurer. If you have extended health insurance, be sure to check if there is coverage for registered occupational therapists (this may be in the physical health or mental health section).
                        After each session you will receive a detailed invoice to submit to your insurer for reimbursement.</p>

                <div class="answer_margin">
                    <p>Yes! If you do not have insurance, and you self-identify as economically vulnerable or are facing financial barriers, please reach out for a negotiated rate within your means.</p>

                <div class="answer_margin">
                    <p>No, diagnostic ADHD assessments are outside the scope of occupational therapy. However OT assessments can often inform steps in the diagnostic/ treatment processes for family physicians, psychologists, psychiatrists, and academic institutions. Additionally, OTs are often recommended after receiving a diagnosis as a resource for individuals with ADHD. Refer to our “Services” page to learn how a mental health OT can support you.</p>

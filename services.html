                            <p>OT can support with managing the impact of mental health symptoms on daily life. This may involving using approaches such as behavioural activation or challenging unhelpful thinking patterns.</p>
                            <p>Additionally, for individuals with ADHD, we often see comorbidities with mental health challenges such as anxiety and depression. OTs can support individuals through tailored support that considers the uniqueness of the ADHD brain.</p> 
                            <p>ADHD also poses challenges for emotional regulation, especially in developing minds! OTs can support with building emotional regulation skills, as well as supporting families and caregivers with co-regulation.</p>
                            <p>Lastly, undiagnosed ADHD often results in mental health challenges as individuals navigate society without accomodations or properly understanding their brain. Whether your diagnosis is new, suspected, or you have known for a while, psychoeducation about ADHD is a powerful tool to build self esteem and readiness to implement strategies to support functioning.</p>

                            <p>Individuals with ADHD often experience challenges in an area that health care providers refer to as “executive functions”. </p>
                            <p>This may look like forgetting or losing things, interrupting, challenges with focusing and starting tasks, trouble multitasking, and more.</p>
                            <p>These challenges can often interfere with daily tasks. Through various approaches, tailored ADHD services can support you to implement tools, strategies, and changes that work specifically for you.</p>

                            <p>Expectations in our current education system may pose challenges for neurodivergent brains. Creating systems of organization and using strategies  that work for you (or your child), are crucical for academic success.</p>
                            <p>Support services with accomodation processes are also available. This may involve approaches such as administering formal assessments, psychoeducation, completing forms, or writing letters. Accomodations are a valuable component of supporting ADHD brains and wellbeing in our current education system.</p>

                            <p>Sleep and physical wellbeing have a large role on the impact of mental health symptoms. Additionally, sleep and physical health impact the ability for ADHD brains to complete tasks involving focusing, inhibition, organization, and working memory (called executive functions!). OT services can support you to implement routines that support sleep hygiene and physical health maintenance.</p>

                            <p>CBT is an evidenced based approach to manage symptoms of mental illnesses such as anxiety and depression. CBT focuses on building awareness of how thoughts can influence feelings, and as a result affect behaviours. ADHD brains can also benefit from building awareness of unhelpful thoughts patterns that lead to unwanted emotions and behaviours that pose challenges for functioning. Questionning and replacing unhelpful thoughts, with balanced thoughts, is at the root of improving mood and behaviour changes. Using CBT informed approaches, OT services can work with you to understand how your thought patterns affect daily life.</p>
